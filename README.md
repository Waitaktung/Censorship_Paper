# Censorship Paper, Course work in University of Mannheim (2021 Spring) Grade: 1.3

Keywords: Rmarkdown, OLS models, data wraggling, ggplots visualisation.  

In this paper, I worked with my colleague to produce a paper on understanding how different types of censorship affect the popularity of democratic governments.
By combining various datasets and manipulating the data, we built several OLS regression models showing that that an increase in internet censorship significantly
increase the government approval rate only when there is a large population of onliner users; while an increase of censorship in traditional media can lead to lower
popularity of democratic governments.
